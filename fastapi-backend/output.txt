========================

This is a basic implementation of a Todo App using Angular. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete todos.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

*   `todo-app`
    *   `app.module.ts`
    *   `app.component.ts`
    *   `app.component.html`
    *   `todo`
        *   `todo.component.ts`
        *   `todo.component.html`
        *   `todo.service.ts`
    *   `todo.model.ts`

**todo.model.ts**
------------------

```typescript
// todo.model.ts
export class Todo {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;

  constructor(id: number, title: string, completed: boolean = false) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = title;
    this.completed = completed;
  }
}
```

**todo.service.ts**
-------------------

```typescript
// todo.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Todo } from './todo.model';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class TodoService {

  private todos: Todo[] = [
    new Todo(1, 'Todo 1'),
    new Todo(2, 'Todo 2'),
    new Todo(3, 'Todo 3')
  ];

  getTodos(): Todo[] {
    return this.todos;
  }

  addTodo(todo: Todo): void {
    this.todos.push(todo);
  }

  updateTodo(id: number, title: string): void {
    const todo = this.todos.find(t => t.id === id);
    if (todo) {
      todo.title = title;
    }
  }

  deleteTodo(id: number): void {
    this.todos = this.todos.filter(t => t.id !== id);
  }

  toggleCompleted(id: number): void {
    const todo = this.todos.find(t => t.id === id);
    if (todo) {
      todo.completed = !todo.completed;
    }
  }
}
```

**todo.component.ts**
---------------------

```typescript
// todo.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { TodoService } from './todo.service';
import { Todo } from './todo.model';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-todo',
  templateUrl: './todo.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./todo.component.css']
})
export class TodoComponent implements OnInit {

  todos: Todo[] = [];
  newTodoTitle = '';

  constructor(private todoService: TodoService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.todos = this.todoService.getTodos();
  }

  addTodo(): void {
    const newTodo = new Todo(this.todos.length + 1, this.newTodoTitle);
    this.todoService.addTodo(newTodo);
    this.todos = this.todoService.getTodos();
    this.newTodoTitle = '';
  }

  updateTodo(id: number, title: string): void {
    this.todoService.updateTodo(id, title);
  }

  deleteTodo(id: number): void {
    this.todoService.deleteTodo(id);
    this.todos = this.todoService.getTodos();
  }

  toggleCompleted(id: number): void {

## Project Structure

1.  **Root Directory**: The root directory of your project, which typically contains all the project files.
2.  **Source Code Directory**: A directory containing all the source code files, often named `src`, `source`, or `app`.
3.  **Components/ Modules Directory**: A directory containing reusable components or modules, often organized by feature or functionality.
4.  **Assets Directory**: A directory containing static assets such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.
5.  **Tests Directory**: A directory containing unit tests, integration tests, and other test-related files.

## File Structure

The file structure will vary depending on the programming language and framework being used. Here are some common file structure patterns:

*   **Go**: Go projects typically have a simple file structure, with all source code files in the same directory or organized by package.
*   **Python**: Python projects often use a more complex file structure, with separate directories for source code, tests, and assets.

## Example Project Structure

Here's an example project structure for a web application:

```
project-name/
|---- src/
|       |---- main.py
|       |---- components/
|       |       |---- header.py
|       |       |---- footer.py
|       |---- assets/
|       |       |---- images/
|       |       |---- styles.css
|       |---- templates/
|       |       |---- index.html
|       |---- requirements.txt
|---- tests/
|       |---- test_main.py
|       |---- test_components.py
|---- README.md
|---- .gitignore
```

## Example File Structure for a Todo App in Angular

Here's an example file structure for a Todo App in Angular:

```
todo-app/
|---- app/
|       |---- app.module.ts
|       |---- app.component.ts
|       |---- app.component.html
|       |---- todo/
|       |       |---- todo.component.ts
|       |       |---- todo.component.html
|       |       |---- todo.service.ts
|---- assets/
|       |---- images/
|       |---- styles.css
|---- environments/
|       |---- environment.ts
|---- node_modules/
|---- package.json
|---- README.md
```
